- ^ in express mean- "^4.18.2": This is the version specifier.
The ^ symbol in the version specifier indicates that npm is allowed to install updates to the package, but it should not install versions that include breaking changes to the API. Specifically, in semantic versioning, the ^ caret symbol allows updates for the specified major version (in this case, version 4), while keeping the minor and patch versions fixed.
- For example, with "^4.18.2", npm can install any version of Express.js that is 4.x.x, but it won't install versions 5.x.x or higher. This is typically done to ensure compatibility and avoid breaking changes when updating dependencies.
